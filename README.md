## About Code Eval

[Code Eval](https://www.codeeval.com) is a website to challenge programmers
with programming problems intended to help you to improve your programming
skills.

## About this repository

There is my attempt to solve some challenges of this project, using the
Python language. The target is to solve as many as I can, and keep the time
consumed by each script below 10 seconds (time limit set by Code Eval).

### Contents:

There are 3 directories, `easy/`, `moderate/` and `hard/` corresponding
with the level of the challenges in the website. Inside of each problem
directory are two types of files, the `*.py` files are the ones with the
code and the `data.txt` files are those which contains the inputs to 
test the code.
